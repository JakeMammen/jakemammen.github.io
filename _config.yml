  Hi, my name is Jake Mammen and I'm the Director of Situational Awareness for an All Hazard Critical Event Managment Company called Early Alert. 
  I manage the Watch Office, which provides 24/7 situational awareness to our clients. 
  In addition, I manage and maintain various GIS tools used to carry out daily operations. 
  GIS is something I am very passionate about and not only does it allow me to enjoy what I do, but it plays an important role in keeping our clients safe.
  <br><br>
 
  I'm an avid football fan, love the outdoors, and enjoy traveling across the country!
