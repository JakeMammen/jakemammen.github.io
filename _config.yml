  First description 
  Hi, my name is Jake Mammen and I'm the Director of Situational Awarness for an Emergency Management Company called Early Alert. 
  I manage the Watch Office, which provides 24/7 situational awareness to our clients. 
  In addition, I manage and maintain various GIS tools used to carry out daily operations. 
  GIS is something Iâ€™ve very passionate about and not only does it allow me to enjoy what I do, but it plays an important role in keeping our clients safe.
