## This page will show some of my spatial programming and GIS experience

**Project description:** This project uses a GIS framework to analyze land suitability for wind turbines based off the impact certain factors such as environmental, ecological, cultural, human settlement, and physical infrastructure have on wind turbine placement. More specifically differences in wind speed; distances from a road network, urban areas, and differences in the topography of the land could prove to be the primary factors in determining land suitability for wind turbines across the United States. This project uses a GIS and programming approach to analyze various energy and geographic datasets. As a result, the various patterns are illustrated through the use of maps by determining wind turbine placement and in return provide some useful information for planners and engineers to aid in decision making.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
